# User Task Mining

This repository hosts source codes for the IUI'17 paper [Identifying Frequent User Tasks from Application Logs](http://www.zcliu.org/papers/IUI17-frequent-tasks.pdf "Identifying Frequent User Tasks from Application Logs").

The "Outlier_Based_Occurrence_Window.java" file contains the implementation of outlier based minimum occurrence window. Given a sequence and an itemset, the code identifies the outlier based minimum occurence window for the itemset within the sequence.
